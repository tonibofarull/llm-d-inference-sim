# KV Cache

The simulator includes a prefix-cache subsystem that mimics vLLM's KV cache behavior without requiring a GPU. It tracks which token blocks are resident in cache, emits ZMQ block-lifecycle events consumed by the llm-d routing layer, and exposes Prometheus metrics compatible with the vLLM metric schema.

## What the KV cache simulation does

- **Prefix cache tracking**: incoming prompts are tokenized and split into fixed-size blocks. Blocks already present in the cache are counted as cache hits and do not need to be prefilled.
- **ZMQ event emission**: `BlockStored`, `BlockRemoved`, and `AllBlocksCleared` events are published over ZMQ so that external consumers (e.g., the llm-d KV cache router) can maintain an accurate view of which blocks each pod holds.
- **Latency simulation**: when `prefill-time-per-token` is configured, cache hits reduce the simulated TTFT proportionally — only non-cached tokens contribute to prefill time.
- **Prometheus metrics**: `vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc`, `vllm:prefix_cache_hits_total`, and `vllm:prefix_cache_queries_total` are reported.

## Enabling KV cache

Add `--enable-kvcache true` (CLI) or `enable-kvcache: true` (YAML config):

```bash
./bin/llm-d-inference-sim --model Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct --enable-kvcache true
```

**Prerequisites**:

1. `POD_IP` environment variable must be set — it is embedded in the ZMQ topic name so subscribers can identify which pod published the event.
2. The vLLM render sidecar must be running — the KV cache relies on actual token IDs to compute block hashes. See [manifests/deployment_kvcache.yaml](../manifests/deployment_kvcache.yaml) for a complete Kubernetes example.
3. KV cache is **not** supported in `--mm-encoder-only` mode.

## Configuration options

All KV cache parameters can be set via CLI flags or the equivalent YAML keys (names are identical).

| Parameter | Type | Default | Description |
|-----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enable-kvcache` | bool | `false` | Enable KV cache simulation |
| `kv-cache-size` | int | `1024` | Maximum number of token blocks the cache can hold |
| `block-size` | int | `16` | Tokens per block; valid values: `8`, `16`, `32`, `64`, `128` |
| `hash-seed` | string | value of `PYTHONHASHSEED` env var | Seed for block key hash generation; must match the seed used by real vLLM instances to ensure identical block hashes |
| `zmq-endpoint` | string | `tcp://127.0.0.1:5557` | ZMQ address to publish events (the simulator dials this address) |
| `event-batch-size` | int | `16` | Maximum number of events bundled into a single ZMQ message |
| `use-vllm-map-event-format` | bool | `false` | Encode events as msgpack maps with named fields (vLLM PR #42892 format) instead of positional arrays. Set to `true` when the consumer expects the named-field schema. |
| `kv-events-replay-endpoint` | string | `""` (disabled) | ZMQ ROUTER address to bind for KV events replay requests. See [KV events replay](#kv-events-replay). |
| `kv-events-replay-queue-size` | int | `1024` | Maximum number of published event batches retained for replay, oldest dropped when full. |
| `global-cache-hit-threshold` | float | `0` (disabled) | Server-wide minimum cache hit rate `[0, 1]`. Requests whose hit rate falls below this threshold return immediately with finish reason `cache_threshold`. Individual requests can override this with the `cache_hit_threshold` field. |

### Example YAML config

```yaml
model: "Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct"
enable-kvcache: true
kv-cache-size: 2048
block-size: 16
hash-seed: "42"
zmq-endpoint: "tcp://127.0.0.1:5557"
event-batch-size: 32
use-vllm-map-event-format: true
global-cache-hit-threshold: 0.5
# latency parameters that interact with the KV cache
prefill-overhead: 10ms
prefill-time-per-token: 50us
prefill-time-std-dev: 5us
```

## Latency and the KV cache

The KV cache interacts with Time To First Token (TTFT) simulation. Behavior depends on the configured **latency calculator** (`latency-calculator` flag) and whether the request specifies disaggregated P/D.

### Aggregated (local) prefill — normal requests

When `do_remote_prefill` is not set in the request, the simulator performs local prefill. How cache hits affect TTFT:

| Calculator | TTFT formula |
|-----------|--------------|
| `default` (empty, no `time-to-first-token` set) | `prefill-overhead + (prompt_tokens − cached_tokens) × prefill-time-per-token` |
| `default` (with `time-to-first-token` set) | fixed `time-to-first-token` — cache hits have no effect |
| `constant` | fixed `time-to-first-token` — cache hits have no effect |
| `per-token` | `prefill-overhead + (prompt_tokens − cached_tokens) × prefill-time-per-token` |

Cache hits reduce TTFT only when using the token-aware path (i.e., `prefill-time-per-token` is set and `time-to-first-token` is not).

### Disaggregated P/D — decode pods

When a request sets `kv_transfer_params.do_remote_prefill: true`, the simulator models the time to transfer pre-computed KV blocks from a remote prefill pod rather than running a local prefill:

| Calculator | TTFT formula |
|-----------|--------------|
| `default` (no `kv-cache-transfer-latency`) | `prompt_tokens × kv-cache-transfer-time-per-token` |
| `default` (with `kv-cache-transfer-latency` set) | fixed `kv-cache-transfer-latency` |
| `constant` | fixed `kv-cache-transfer-latency` |
| `per-token` | `prompt_tokens × kv-cache-transfer-time-per-token` |

Relevant latency flags for disaggregated P/D:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `kv-cache-transfer-latency` | Fixed KV block transfer time |
| `kv-cache-transfer-latency-std-dev` | Std dev for the fixed transfer time (max 30% of base value) |
| `kv-cache-transfer-time-per-token` | Per-token KV block transfer time |
| `kv-cache-transfer-time-std-dev` | Std dev for the per-token transfer time |

See [configuration.md](configuration.md) for all latency parameters.

## ZMQ event emission

When `enable-kvcache` is true and `zmq-endpoint` is set, the simulator publishes KV cache events over a ZMQ PUB socket.

### Topic format

```
kv@<POD_IP>@<model-name>
```

Example: `kv@10.0.0.1@Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`

The model name used is the base model name (`--model`), not a served-model-name alias.

When `KV_EVENTS_INCLUDE_VLLM_PORT=true` is set, the serving port (`--port`, default `8000`) is appended to `POD_IP`, so the topic becomes:

```
kv@<POD_IP>:<port>@<model-name>
```

Example: `kv@10.0.0.1:8000@Qwen/Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct`

Enable this when the subscriber (for example the EPP prefix-cache scorer) addresses pods as `<Address>:<Port>`. With the plain `<ip>` topic, the block index stores the pod key as `<ip>`, which never matches the scorer's `<ip>:<port>` lookup, so cache-aware routing finds no hits. Defaults to off (see [Environment variables](configuration.md#environment-variables)).

### Message format

Each message has three ZMQ frames:

| Frame | Content |
|-------|---------|
| 0 | Topic string (UTF-8) |
| 1 | 8-byte big-endian sequence number (monotonically increasing per simulator instance) |
| 2 | msgpack-encoded event batch |

The event batch is a msgpack array with three fields:
1. `ts` (float64) — Unix timestamp in seconds (`nanoseconds / 1e9`)
2. `events` (array) — list of msgpack-encoded event arrays
3. `data_parallel_rank` (int, optional) — the rank index of the simulator instance that published the batch; `0` for a single-instance deployment, `0`–`N-1` when running with `--data-parallel-size N`

### Event types

Three event types are emitted. The wire encoding — either a positional array or a named-field map — depends on `--use-vllm-map-event-format` (see [Encoding formats](#encoding-formats) below).

#### BlockStored

Emitted when new blocks are allocated for a request:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `tag` (keyed `"type"` in map format) | string | `"BlockStored"` |
| `block_hashes` | array of uint64 | hashes of the stored blocks |
| `parent_block_hash` | uint64 (or `null` in map format) | hash of the last already-cached block before these new blocks; `0` (legacy) or `null` (map format) when the request has no cached prefix |
| `token_ids` | array of uint32 | tokens contained in these blocks |
| `block_size` | int | tokens per block (mirrors `--block-size`) |
| `lora_id` | int (optional) | LoRA adapter ID, omitted for base model requests |
| `medium` | string (optional) | always `"GPU"` |
| `lora_name` | string (optional) | LoRA adapter name, omitted for base model requests |

#### BlockRemoved

Emitted when a block is evicted to make room for a new request:

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `tag` (keyed `"type"` in map format) | string | `"BlockRemoved"` |
| `block_hashes` | array of uint64 | hashes of the evicted blocks |
| `medium` | string (optional) | always `"GPU"` |

#### AllBlocksCleared

Emitted when the cache is fully discarded (see [Sleep mode](#sleep-mode-integration)):

| Field | Type | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| `tag` (keyed `"type"` in map format) | string | `"AllBlocksCleared"` |

#### Encoding formats

**Legacy format** (default, `use-vllm-map-event-format: false`): each event is a msgpack **array**. The `tag` field is at position 0; all other fields follow in the order listed above. `parent_block_hash` is a `uint64` and is `0` when the request has no cached prefix.

**Map format** (`use-vllm-map-event-format: true`): each event is a msgpack **map** with named string keys, matching the schema introduced in vLLM PR #42892 and consumed by `VLLMAdapter`. The `tag` field is keyed `"type"`. `parent_block_hash` is `null` (not `0`) when the request has no cached prefix; `VLLMAdapter` normalises `null` to `0` on the consumer side.

### Event batching

Events are buffered and sent together for efficiency. A batch is flushed when either:
- The number of pending events reaches `event-batch-size`, or
- 1 second elapses since the last flush.

## KV events replay

When `kv-events-replay-endpoint` is set, the simulator additionally binds a ZMQ ROUTER socket that lets a late-joining or reconnecting subscriber catch up on batches it missed on the live PUB stream, instead of waiting for new events.

- The simulator keeps a sliding window of the last `kv-events-replay-queue-size` published batches (default `1024`), keyed by their sequence number. Once the window is full, the oldest batch is dropped as new ones arrive.

### Request format

A request is a REQ-style 3-frame message — `[identity, empty-delimiter, startSeq]` — where `startSeq` is an 8-byte big-endian `uint64` meaning "replay every batch with `seq >= startSeq`"; malformed requests are silently ignored.

### Reply format

The simulator replies with each matching batch as a 3-frame message — `[topic, seq (8-byte big-endian), msgpack payload]` — identical in shape to the live PUB frames, so a subscriber can decode replayed and live batches the same way. 

After the last matching batch, the simulator sends an end-of-replay sentinel: empty topic, `seq = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF`, empty payload. The client should treat this as "you are caught up".

If `startSeq` is older than every batch still in the window, all retained batches are replayed — there is no error signal for "some history was already evicted"; the client has to also track this against its own expectations.

Replies for one client are sent from a dedicated goroutine, but this only isolates a slow client from the ROUTER socket's *receive* loop — new incoming replay requests still get parsed while a reply is in flight. It does **not** isolate clients from each other's replies: all replies on this endpoint go out over the same ROUTER socket, and the underlying ZMQ library serializes every send on that socket behind one shared, unbounded-blocking write. A client that stops draining its own socket without closing the connection therefore stalls replay for every other client on this rank too, not just its own, until that connection is closed — there is no per-message timeout that can free it. Clients must actively read every reply until the sentinel (or close the connection promptly on error) to avoid this.

## Block eviction policy

When the cache is full and a new block must be stored, the simulator evicts one **unused** block (a block whose last request has already completed). Active blocks — those belonging to a currently running request — are never evicted.

Eviction priority:
1. Oldest unused block belonging to an **unloaded LoRA adapter**
2. Oldest unused block belonging to any model (base or loaded LoRA)

This mirrors vLLM's behavior of preferring to keep blocks for loaded adapters resident.

## LoRA awareness

Block keys incorporate the model name, so a prompt cached under the base model is distinct from the same prompt cached under a LoRA adapter. When a LoRA adapter is loaded or unloaded, its blocks shift eviction priority accordingly:

- **Loaded adapter**: its blocks are treated the same as base model blocks (lower eviction priority)
- **Unloaded adapter**: its blocks become the first eviction candidates

`BlockStored` events include `lora_id` and `lora_name` fields when the request targets a LoRA adapter, allowing subscribers to associate blocks with the correct adapter.

## Cache hit threshold

The `cache_hit_threshold` feature allows routing decisions based on whether the current pod has enough of the prompt already cached.

### Per-request field

Include `cache_hit_threshold` in the request body (value in `[0, 1]`):

```json
{
  "model": "my-model",
  "messages": [...],
  "cache_hit_threshold": 0.8
}
```

If the fraction of cached prompt tokens is below the threshold, the simulator returns an empty response immediately with finish reason `cache_threshold`. The caller can then route the request to a pod with a higher cache hit rate.

### Server-wide default

Set `global-cache-hit-threshold` to apply a threshold to all requests that do not specify one:

```yaml
global-cache-hit-threshold: 0.5
```

A per-request `cache_hit_threshold` always takes precedence over the global value.

## Response usage fields

When KV cache is enabled, the response `usage` object includes cached token information:

```json
{
  "usage": {
    "prompt_tokens": 100,
    "completion_tokens": 50,
    "total_tokens": 150,
    "prompt_tokens_details": {
      "cached_tokens": 64
    }
  }
}
```

`cached_tokens` is the number of prompt tokens that were found in the local KV cache.

## Prometheus metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `vllm:kv_cache_usage_perc` | Fraction of KV cache blocks currently in use (0–1). Updated after each request starts and finishes. |
| `vllm:prefix_cache_hits_total` | Cumulative number of prompt tokens served from cache across all requests |
| `vllm:prefix_cache_queries_total` | Cumulative number of prompt tokens checked against the cache across all requests |
| `vllm:cache_config_info` | Static info gauge with labels `cache_dtype`, `num_gpu_blocks`, `num_cpu_blocks`, `block_size` |

The hit rate at any point is `prefix_cache_hits_total / prefix_cache_queries_total`.

## Sleep mode integration

When [sleep mode](http-endpoints.md) is enabled (`--enable-sleep-mode` and `VLLM_SERVER_DEV_MODE=1`), the KV cache is integrated with the `/sleep` and `/wake_up` endpoints:

- **`POST /sleep`**: disables the cache and emits an `AllBlocksCleared` event so that subscribers know all blocks have been released.
- **`POST /wake_up`** (no `tags` parameter, or `tags=kv_cache`): re-enables the cache.

## Kubernetes deployment

[manifests/deployment_kvcache.yaml](../manifests/deployment_kvcache.yaml) provides a complete example including:

- The vLLM render sidecar (`vllm/vllm-openai-cpu`) as a native sidecar init container
- `POD_IP` injected from the pod's downward API

Key environment variable setup:

```yaml
env:
  - name: POD_IP
    valueFrom:
      fieldRef:
        fieldPath: status.podIP
  # Optional: append the serving port to the topic so the pod key matches the
  # EPP prefix-cache scorer's <ip>:<port> addressing. Defaults to off.
  # - name: KV_EVENTS_INCLUDE_VLLM_PORT
  #   value: "true"
```

Without `POD_IP`, the simulator will fail to start when `enable-kvcache: true`.
